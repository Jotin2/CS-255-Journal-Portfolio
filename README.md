Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for the DriverPass project wanted to develop a system that would allow students to be able to take online classes and practice tests for the driving test at the DMV. They wanted us to develop a system where users would be able to create an account for DriverPass and be able to make reservations with a driving teacher from out of three lesson packages. The user would also be able to take online tests as well.

What did you do particularly well?

During the DriverPass project, I think that what I did well was designing the UML diagrams such as the UML Use Case diagram, UML Activity Diagram, UML Sequence Diagram and lastly the UML Class Diagram.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part of my work on the documents to revise, I would revise some parts of the business requirements document. These parts would include sections such as objectives and goals, security, functional / nonfunctional requirements etc... Making them more precise and clear would be important for a real business requirement document to be successful. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interpreting the user's needs is important while designing as they are the client and without the functionality that they want the system to have, the project would not be useful to them at all. In order to interpret the user's needs, UML Use Case Diagrams are made in order to flesh out what the users should be able to do, as per what the client wants. This makes it much easier to design the system around the use cases, are requirements are clearly defined.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to desgining software would be to get clear requirements from the client, and to understand what the user would need to be able to do. After understanding the underlying system, a UML Class Diagram can be made which would make it much easier when actually coding the system.
